## Welcome to Gary's Pages

Hi, there. I am Gary, currently a master of data science student in Macquarie University.

This is my github repository of my previous projects.

### Some story about me
Before doing my master degree, I am an eCommerce specialist/data analyst in Hong Kong and China for 6 years. My role focused on deriving insight from data and help the company to make revenue through the web. I used Google Analytics, Google Ads, Google Data Studio, Advance Excel techniques and Tableau. Apart from data analysis, I also worked in other digital marketing related area such as PPC, SEO and web development.

I started my master degree in Feb 2018 and expect to finish in 2020. The master degree has a combined of statistic and computing units.

Statistic courses provided a fundamental of statistical learning. Courses I took included applied statistics, statistical theory, data mining, generalised linear model, multivariate analysis and modern computational method of statistics. I have also did external course during the 2019 AMSI summer school on mathematical method of machine learning and optimisation theory. I used R in all of my statistic courses.

Computer courses provide the knowledge to implement machine learning as well as concept in web and data interchange. Courses I took included Data Science, Web Technology, big data technology, Enterprise Application Integration and Project Management. I was a high distinction student in Data Science class. I have also involved in a research internship with a local voice recognition company in Jan-Feb2019.

This page will contain mainly my projects written in python.
